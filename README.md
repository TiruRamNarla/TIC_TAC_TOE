# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game (Single & Multiplayer with AI)

**By Tiru Ram Narla**

This is a console-based Python implementation of the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game that supports:
- Single-player mode (Easy or Hard difficulty with AI)
- Multiplayer mode (2 users on the same system)

The game demonstrates the use of recursion, minimax algorithm for AI logic, and basic input validation—all within a simple command-line interface.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Single-player mode:
  - **Easy AI:** Makes random moves.
  - **Hard AI:** Uses the Minimax algorithm for unbeatable gameplay.
- 👥 Two-player mode: Human vs Human
- 🎯 Clear display of game board after every move
- 🧠 Win detection based on all possible winning combinations
- 🔁 Recursive AI and user input handling

---

## 🧠 AI Logic

The Hard AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** to evaluate all possible moves and choose the one that maximizes its chances of winning (and minimizes the opponent's).

The Easy AI selects a move randomly.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- Standard Library: `random` (for easy AI)

## 📋 How to Play

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python tic_tac_toe.py
